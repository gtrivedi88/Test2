NOTE: The command mentioned assumes that you have defined project dependencies in *pyproject.toml*. However, if you have defined the project dependencies in either the *setup.py* or *setup.cfg*, ensure to update the command accordingly.

I have often seen pip-compile used with a requirements.in file. Is this not a suggested possible path?
