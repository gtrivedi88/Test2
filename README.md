In {ProdutName}, hermetic builds are achieved by restrciting netwowk access to the build. Consequently, many builds using supported languages fail as they are unable to retrieve dependencies from respositories. To assist with building these artifacts, {ProductName} uses Cachi2 to prefetch the package manager dependencies for the supported-languages. Cachi2 is a wrapper around the package managers that makes it easy to prefetch and cache dependencies. It also helps generate a manifest of all dependencies included in your builds, ensuring transparency and maintainability.
