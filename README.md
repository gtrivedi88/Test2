To minimize the time it takes to build and test your pipelines, run different test scenarios on your commit simultaneously, in parallel with one another. To run these parallel tests, you need to create a new namespace; otherwise, the names of Deployment, Service, Secret, ConfigMap, and Route would collide with another and prevent the execution of the test. When you create a new namespace to run different tests in parallel to each other, you then can receive actionable feedback and quicken the development of your code.
