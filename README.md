Specify the package manager lock file relative to the package path. If the package manager lock file is located in the root of your repository, against the value enter `gomod`. Otherwise, provide the path to the lock file in the JSON object format. Additionally, if you have multiple lock files, you can provide the path to the lock file in the JSON array format. For example, `[{"path": ".", "type": "gomod"}, {"path": "subpath/to/other/repository", "type": "gomod"}]`. Here, `.` indicates that the package manager lock file is located in the root of your repository.
