In {ProdutName}, hermetic builds are achieved by restrciting netwowk access to the build. Consequently, builds using supported languages may fail if they cannot retrieve dependencies from respositories. To address this, {ProductName} uses Cachi2 to prefetch package manager dependencies for the supported languages. Cachi2 serves as a wrapper around package managers, simplifying dependency prefetching and caching. It also generates a manifest that lists all the dependencies included in your builds, ensuring transparency and maintainability.
