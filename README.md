In order to support this class of hermetic builds, not only does Cachi2 need to prefetch the dependencies, however,
but some build flows will need additional changes whether that is to the build process (i.e. leveraging defined 
[environment variables](#generate-environment-variables) or using Cachi2 to [inject project files](#inject-project-files))
