Hermetic builds refer to a controlled build process where all required resources and dependencies must pass through the build system. This strict control ensures that the build system has complete visibility and control over the dependencies needed for the build, including the ability to accurately collect, inquire, analyze, and manage all dependencies during the build process. By minimizing external dependencies and enforcing a centralized management approach, hermetic builds provide a predictable and reliable build environment.
Hermetic builds also focus on establishing a build pipeline that captures and maintains a precise record of the buildâ€™s origin, dependencies, and modifications. This emphasis on provenance allows for better traceability, reproducibility, and auditability of the build process. By having comprehensive visibility into the entire pipeline, hermetic builds enable the identification and resolution of issues, facilitate collaboration, and support long-term maintenance of the builds.
