Since hermetic builds are enabled in {ProductName} by restricting network access to the build, many builds using common package managers will fail as they are unable to call out to the repositories to pull in dependencies. In order to assist with building these artifacts, {ProductName} uses Cachi2 to prefetch the package manager dependencies for the <<supported-languages>>. Cachi2 is a wrapper around the package managers that makes it easy to prefetch and cache dependencies. It also helps generate a manifest of all dependencies included in your builds, ensuring transparency and maintainability.
